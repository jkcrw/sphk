Sparrowhawk (stylized `sphk`) is a stenographic (chord-based) input system designed to improve the efficiency and ergonomics of keyboard usage in the 21st century and beyond.

In particular, `sphk` makes it possible to:

- Input natural language at speeds in excess of 200WPM (currently, English and Japanese supported)
- Navigate and edit text from the comfort of the home row
- Input symbols and Unicode characters semantically
- Input numbers on a chorded ten-key numpad
- Execute application-specific keyboard shortcuts and system-wide macros semantically

`sphk` has been in active development and full-time use since early 2017, and is now in the process of being documented and released for the world to see :) .

## Demos
Stenoing song lyrics to demonstrate basic usage. `sphk` was initially implemented on the ErgoDox EZ but is now implemented on the purpose-built [aodox](https://github.com/jkcrw/aodox).
